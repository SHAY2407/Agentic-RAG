Based on the provided context, the circular seems to be related to a system for managing inspections and defects, possibly for infrastructure projects. It involves steps like starting a joint inspection, selecting a project, adding defects, submitting inspections, and managing requests for extensions of time (EOT) for rectification. The system appears to use OTP authentication and allows for adding images and remarks to defect reports.
